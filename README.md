# Eat Da Burger

## Description:
Eat Da Burger is a full stack web application that allows users to create, view, and update different burgers. Once a burger is added, it will appear under the section 'Burgers that have not been eaten' if it has not been devoured and under the other section, 'Burgers that have been devoured', if the opposite is true. You are able to click on the button next to any burger to switch it into the other section. Enjoy!
